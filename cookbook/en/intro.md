# Welcome to AgentScope Runtime Cookbook

## What is AgentScope Runtime?

**AgentScope Runtime** is a comprehensive runtime framework that addresses two critical challenges: **effective agent deployment** and **sandboxed tool execution**. With built-in infrastructure for context management and secure sandboxing, it provides a framework-agnostic solution that works with popular open-source agent frameworks and custom implementations. Whether you need to deploy agents at scale or ensure safe tool interactions, AgentScope Runtime delivers essential infrastructure with full observability and developer-friendly deployment.

This cookbook will guide you through building robust agent applications using **AgentScope Runtime**.

## Dual-Core Architecture

**⚙️ Agent Deployment Runtime (Engine)**

Infrastructure for deploying, managing, and running agent applications with context management (session context, long memory, RAG), and environment control.

**🛠️ Tool Execution Runtime (Sandbox)**

Secure, isolated environments that let your agents safely execute tools, control browsers, manage files, and integrate MCP tools - all without compromising your system security.

## Why AgentScope Runtime?

* **🏗️ Deployment Infrastructure**: Built-in services for session management, memory, and sandbox environment control

* **🔒 Sandboxed Tool Execution**: Isolated sandboxes ensure safe tool execution without system compromise

* **🔧 Framework Agnostic**: Not tied to any specific framework. Works seamlessly with popular open-source agent frameworks and custom implementations

* ⚡ **Developer Friendly**: Simple deployment with powerful customization options

* **📊 Observability**: Comprehensive tracing and monitoring for runtime operations
